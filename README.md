![Community coding projects](logo.png)

Are you interested in neuromorphics and want to contribute to the open source community? âœ¨ Then join the community coding sessions where we improve the neuromorphic software ecosystem, one issue at the time ðŸš€

We'll meet **every Monday from 16-18 CET** on the [Open Neuromorphic Discord server](https://discord.gg/aPFsSRA7Nf).

The goal is to meet up, hack on projects, close issues, and have fun!

## ðŸš€ Completed pull requests and issues ðŸš€
The entire point is to move things forward and get stuff done---and it's working! The below issues and pull requests were all closed during the hacking hours:

* [AEStream](https://github.com/aestream/aestream): [#96](https://github.com/aestream/aestream/pull/96), [#98](https://github.com/aestream/aestream/pull/98), [#100](https://github.com/aestream/aestream/pull/100), [#108](https://github.com/aestream/aestream/pull/108), [#110](https://github.com/aestream/aestream/pull/110), [#111](https://github.com/aestream/aestream/pull/111)
* [NIR](https://github.com/neuromorphs/nir/): [#76](https://github.com/neuromorphs/nir/pull/76), [#104](https://github.com/neuromorphs/nir/pull/104)
* [Open-Neuromorphic.github.io](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/open-neuromorphic.github.io): [#169](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/open-neuromorphic.github.io/pull/169)

## Projects with open issues that needs help
Want to help out? Pick a project you care about and start hacking ðŸ‘‡

<!-- NOTE TO CONTRIBUTORS
Every hour, a script will search for two HTML comment tags with the org/repo name.
Everything between the tags WILL BE REPLACED with issues that are open AND have the talk "help wanted".
If you want to add your own project, simply add three lines:
1. The header with the project title,
2. The starting HTML comment, and
3. The ending HTML comment
