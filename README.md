# Community coding projects

This repository contains a list of community projects, we'll meet **every Monday from 16-18 CET** on the [Open Neuromorphic Discord server](https://discord.gg/aPFsSRA7Nf).

The goal is to meet up, hack on projects, close issues, and have fun!

## Projects and issues
These projects have issues that needs your help? What are you waiting for? Get hacking!

<!-- NOTE TO CONTRIBUTORS
Every hour, a script will search for two HTML comment tags with the org/repo name.
Everything between the tags WILL BE REPLACED with issues that are open AND have the talk "help wanted".
If you want to add your own project, simply add three lines:
1. The header with the project title,
2. The starting HTML comment, and
3. The ending HTML comment
